# Notes 

1. Regarding `Top P` and Temparature 

How They Work Together

    Low temp + Low top-p → Very strict and predictable output.

    High temp + High top-p → Wild, creative, and sometimes random output.

    Low temp + High top-p → A mix of variety but still controlled.

    High temp + Low top-p → Weird but within limits.
