CP Guielines | [`Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gen-ai-intensive-course-capstone-2025q1/overview) - Note this is a private link, requires kaggle account to access

# Guidelines 

## Description
You must demonstrate what you've learned in this course by applying it to a use case of your choosing in a Kaggle Notebook. You must demonstrate in your code at least three (3) of the generative AI capabilities you learned in this course (see the Gen AI capabilities section below).

Optionally, you can also submit the following to add to your Capstone Project:

**a blogpost**: a public blogpost on your capstone project. Think of this blogpost as an opportunity to explain what use case you chose, what problem/idea you were trying to solve, and how you solve it with Gen AI.

**a YouTube video**: a public YouTube video on your capstone project. No minimum or maximum duration.
The use case is open-ended so feel free to be creative, but should ideally solve a real-world problem. You can also find some ideas in the "Use Case Ideas" section below.
